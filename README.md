This repository contains the official Software Test Plan (STP) for the Online Learning Platform, a comprehensive web-based application designed to provide a unified and flexible educational experience for students and instructors.
📖 Project Overview
The Online Learning Platform is designed to address the challenges of modern education, which have been accelerated by the shift to remote and hybrid learning. The platform centralizes course management, content delivery, assessments, and communication, eliminating the need for disjointed tools like Zoom, email, and separate file-sharing services.
This document outlines the complete strategy for testing the platform to ensure it is functional, reliable, secure, and user-friendly before deployment. It covers the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for all testing activities.
